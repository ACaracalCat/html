Start your html journey with the basics!

In htmlbasics.html you can get a template to help you.

First, make texts by <p>text here</p>
That would make the word "text here"

To make headings, do a <h1>My Heading</h1>
These come in different sizes!

To change the size, change the number in the <h()>
Write an html file with this!
